Starting a blog is something that has been on my todo list for a long time. 

I first had this idea while still at university. I was going to make a small portfolio site as
a pet project and learn a little along the way. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, it never
came to be

> It's not that I didn't want to. I *really* did.

I even went so far as to create a prototype and throw it up on some shady free web host. However, it quickly became apparent that things were going to look a little sparse as I didn't exactly have a huge portfolio back then! After mulling it over for a while I reasoned that a blog would a relatively easy way to flesh this out. 

At the time I had just finished a year long internship at Microsoft in Dublin so could probably pull together some decent material.  With hindsight I really wish I had followed up on this but alas. The posts weren't written, the hosting expired and the files lay forgotten on a backup hard drive.

The next time I seriously considered it was was just after I was hired by [EventMAP](http://www.eventmapsolutions.com) as one of their first engineers. This was a hugely exciting time for me but with the challenges of the new job and learning how to manage the pretty heavy workload, the blog was sidelined once again.

> Fast forward to today. 

In January I passed the first year viva on my Phd program and am still heading up the web development at EventMAP. I am probably busier than ever, indeed I created the first files for this site back in February! 
So it's reasonable to as - why start a blog now then?!

Well, over the past number of years I have made it a habit to specifically dedicate time to reading up on tech and tech related things. Usually this takes the form of [reddit](http://www.reddit.com), [hacker news](http://news.ycombinator.com) or my [feedly](http://feedly.com) list. The **vast** majority of the content is made up of blog posts or recommendations I have found through posts. As time goes on I find myself
turning to my feed more and more as I curate it to focus on my favourite bloggers and content most applicable to me. This often has left me feeling somewhat guilty. 

> All take and no give

Then I recently read an old post from 2010 by Scott Hanselman - [Do they deserve the gift of your keystrokes?](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DoTheyDeserveTheGiftOfYourKeystrokes.aspx)

While the premise of "you are going to die soon" is a touch morbid, I really do find it profoundly challenging at the same time.

> So whats next?

With all this in mind I hope to use this as a way to challenge myself with the following goals:

- Motivation to develop up and share some unfinished side projects
- Learn some new skills
- Contribute back to the online communities I have learnt so much from 

Lets see how it goes.
